  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Lasagne is a fantastic family dish serving many platefuls from relatively cheap ingredients and simple preparation. 
    Start by cooking beef, adding onion, celery and carrot finely diced till soft. Add tinned tomatoes, tomatoe puree and beef stock with slat and pepper to taste.
    While this is simmering, in another saucepan, cook butter, flour and salt and pepepr to make a roux and add milk and cheese. 
    This will make a delicious creamy bechemel sauce once whisked until there are no more lumps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bring to a simmer, leave to thicken and prepare the layers by spooning the ragu in a thin, even layer, then layering on the lasagene sheets. 
    Then add a layer of evenly spready bechemel sauce. Repeat these layers in sequence until it is all used up. 
    End with a final layer of bechemel sauce and sprinkle cheese on top.
